# PolyChat

PolyChat is an innovative super app built on the Polygon network, designed to foster meaningful conversations within a secure and protected environment. This is made possible through the implementation of Polygon ID, an advanced technology that ensures users have a safe and private identity.

The app offers a seamless experience by allowing users to send NFTs and tokens directly from the chat interface, eliminating the need to switch to another application.

Furthermore, PolyChat enables users to permanently store their messages on an immutable blockchain, guaranteeing that their cherished memories will endure indefinitely.

## Verifiability

With a focus on security and privacy, Polychat serves as a reliable and confidential chat platform that provides identity verification. It comprises two types of chatrooms: public and private. Public chatrooms are accessible to all, whereas private chatrooms require users to verify their identities, safeguarding confidentiality and authenticity within the conversations.

## Chats

PolyChat goes beyond being a conventional messaging platform by empowering companies to create dedicated chatrooms for their customers. These exclusive chatrooms offer customers access to valuable company information and updates. Additionally, PolyChat allows companies to share advertising revenue with the members of their chatrooms.

By utilizing PolyChat, businesses can enhance their relationships with customers. Through the provision of exclusive information and updates, as well as the opportunity to share in ad revenue, companies can foster customer loyalty and increase revenue streams.

It is important to acknowledge that larger corporations, due to their extensive reach and larger customer base, typically generate a significant portion of the revenue in this dynamic. Nonetheless, PolyChat remains a valuable tool for small businesses, enabling them to cultivate customer relationships and boost their revenue, albeit on a comparatively smaller scale.

One of the notable features of PolyChat is the ability for companies to create targeted ad campaigns within their chat groups. To initiate an ad campaign, companies define a budget and transfer it to the AdRevenueShare smart contract. Members of the chat groups can then stake Polygon's native token, MATIC, and earn a proportional share of the ad budget based on the amount of MATIC they stake.


## How can a company setup an ad campaign?

Here is a more detailed explanation of the process:

1. A company creates an ad campaign and determines a budget.
2. The company transfers the budget to the `AdRevenueShare` smart contract.
3. Members of the chat group can then stake MATIC tokens.
4. The amount of MATIC staked determines the share of the ad budget that each member will earn.
5. The ad campaign is then displayed in the chat group.
6. The ad budget is distributed to the members of the chat group who staked MATIC tokens after the ad campaign gets closed.
